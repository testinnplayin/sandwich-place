                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <h3>From humble beginnings</h3>
                    <p>Shelly started out in a completely different field, planting trees throughout Camden County. \
                        During this time there was always something that Shelly came back to: <strong>making sandwiches</strong>! \
                        It was something she was reputedly good at too! Her friends had a habit of inviting themselves over to partake of her awesome sandwiches!\
                        After almost a decade of planting, Shelly decided to take the plunge and open her own business. It began as a food truck in Camden.</p>
                    <h3>Onto growth!</h3>
                    <p>The reputation of her food truck spread throughout not just Camden but also in Philadelphia. She was doing an amazing business. \
                        Everyone loves <strong>Shelly's sandwiches</strong>! Maybe it was the fact that she has always supported local farmers and believes \
                        in getting the freshest ingredients within her reach. Maybe it was the exotic and unique sandwich menu she had in addition to the classics\
                        Maybe it was her perpetual, sunny disposition but she eventually opened a shop in Cherry Hill.</p>
                    <h3>The shop today</h3>
                    <p>The shop has been operating on Springdale Road for many years now with plans to open a further one in Camden. We hope you drop by to see\
                    what we're all about!</p>
